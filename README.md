# InsightProject
This contains a description and some files relating to my Insight Data Science Fellowship project.
I worked on a consulting project with a startup incubator who wishes to be anonymous. I created visualizations of application data for them so that they can streamline their selection process and reduce unintentional bias in funding. A more detailed account of the project i published here: https://medium.com/@carissa.shafto/industrybias-a3af5762d8e3. The slides for a short presentation of the project are included in this repo.
